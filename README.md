# ðŸŒ¡ Build a Temperature Converter Program 
## ðŸ”° Introduction

This is a simple Java console application developed to convert temperature values between Celsius (Â°C), Fahrenheit (Â°F), and Kelvin (Â°K).  
It helps users convert a given temperature from one unit to others â€” either from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin or vice versa.

This project was built as part of an internship task at *Prodigy Infotech* and serves as a beginner-friendly utility to understand basic conditionals, input/output, and Java logic.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Accepts temperature input from the user
- âœ… Supports input units: C, F, K
- âœ… Converts based on the Temperature unit:
  - *Celsius â†’ Fahrenheit, Kelvin
  - *Fahrenheit â†’ Celsius, Kelvin
  - *Kelvin â†’ Celsius, Fahrenheit
- âœ… Uses simple formulas and clean logic for the temperature conversion
- âœ… Built using *IntelliJ IDEA*
- âœ… Beginner-friendly and easy to understand
